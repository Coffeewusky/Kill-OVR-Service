# Kill-OVR-Service
This simple script addresses the lack of an option within the Oculus application to prevent background processes by closing the OVR service after the application is closed.
> ovrserver_x64.exe <

*Use administrator for the script to work*

Known Issue: Using this script will reset your (OculusDebugTool.exe) settings if you have set any.
