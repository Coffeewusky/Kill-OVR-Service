# Kill-OVR-Service
This simple script closes the OVR services using CMD that is running in the background, after closing your Oculus application. The script makes it easier to close these services without manually trying, since there is no option in the Oculus application to prevent running in the background.


*Use administrator for the script to work*

Known Issue: Using this script will reset your (OculusDebugTool.exe) settings if you have set any.
